## Abstract

Text summarization can be defined as “is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning”. There are bunch of studies about this task. Most of them are in English. We aimed to create a Turkish abstractive text summarization pipeline from scratch (Crawler to deployment).
